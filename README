Error correction for oxford nanopore reads


Requires:
        Blast to be in path
        SGE or similar scheduler that can 

Installation:
        Make a python virtual environment on a cluster
        with a shared filesystem

        >virtualenv nanocorr
        >source nanocorr/bin/activate
        
        > python setup.py install 


Running:
        Make sure you are in the virtualenv
        >source nanocorr/bin/activate

        Partition your reads for distributed processing
        >python partition.py 100 500 input.fa
        
        A series of directories will be created by the partitioning
        [0001,0002,...]. In each directory run the nanocorr.py script
        on SGE or similar system that sets SGE_TASK_ID environment
        variable. Set the -t parameter to the number of files in the 
        directory.
        
        >qsub -cwd -v PATH,LD_LIBRARY_PATH -t 1:500 -j y -o nanocorr_out /path/to/nanocorr.py query.fa reference.fa
        
        The query file will be "blasted" against each previously partitioned read.        
        The corrected reads will be in the resulting "fa" files in the partition
        directories.
        If you supply a reference genome, the corrected reads will be blasted
        against that and a ".refblast6.q" file will be created for each partition.
        This will be the corrected reads aligned to the reference. Just make sure
        the blast db has been created for the reference.
